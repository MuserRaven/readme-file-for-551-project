## Introduction

Our LA Crime Data Interactive Application is a straightforward, web-based platform created by students to explore and interact with Los Angeles crime data from 2010 to present. Utilizing extensive datasets sourced from Kaggle and compiled into two large CSV files, our project enables users to insert new crime data entries, enhancing the database's comprehensiveness over time.

A key feature of the application is its interactive map, allowing users to select specific areas and define a search radius to filter crime incidents based on categories: violent, lesser violent, and other. This functionality provides a practical tool for analyzing crime trends, offering valuable insights for academic research, policy-making, and public awareness. Through this project, we aim to make LA crime data more accessible and actionable for our community.

## Data Source

This dataset reflects incidents of crime in the City of Los Angeles dating back to 2020. This data is transcribed from original crime reports that are typed on paper and therefore there may be some inaccuracies within the data. Some location fields with missing data are noted as (0°, 0°). Address fields are only provided to the nearest hundred block in order to maintain privacy. This data is as accurate as the data in the database. Please note questions or concerns in the comments.
